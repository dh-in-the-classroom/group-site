title: "Race & Technology Map"
excerpt: This map aims to make visible the global and international implications different forms of technology have on understandings of race, which often remain obscured or are opaque. For example, the physical infrastructures that power Silicon Valley are connected to places like Guam, where a majority of the world's undersea communication cables are bundled. Or Project Green light in Detroit, which set up cameras a traffic lights to assist law enforcement, not only primarily tracks people in majority Black and Latino neighborhoods, it also has captured almost every Michigan resident. Where will this biometric data go? How will it be used by the police and other law enforcement agencies in the future? This map will aim to make those connections visible.
