excerpt: 'Jackie Robinson was the first African American man to intergrate Major League Baseball, but many tried before him and many came after him. He opened the door for many African American ballplayers, but the opening of this door came at both a personal and communal cost.'

## Introduction
Jackie robinson was not the first African American player to intergrate baseball. All though many credit him as the national pastime's first black player, Bud Fowler is recognized as one of the first Black men to play organized baseball in 1854. Additionally, Moses and Welday Walker played with the Toledo club of the American Assoication in 1884. They along with Bud Fowler can be regarded as the 19th century's Jackie Robinsons. After the Civil War, the nation remained deeply divided and baseball's founding father imagined the sport as a tool rfeunification. 

However, they reimagined the sport with the exclusion of players like Moses and Weldy Walker by adhereing to the "gentleman's agreement." With this agreeement Major League owners agreed not to sign Black baseball players to their teams. This agreement helped keep Black baseball players out of the Major Leagues and helped continue segregation not only in baseball but in life.
